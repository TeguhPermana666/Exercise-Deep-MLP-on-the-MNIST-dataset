- Hand on machine learning Chapter 10 Exercise No.10 :

Train a deep MLP on the MNIST dataset (you can load it using keras.data
sets.mnist.load_data(). See if you can get over 98% precision. Try searching
for the optimal learning rate by using the approach presented in this chapter (i.e.,
by growing the learning rate exponentially, plotting the loss, and finding the
point where the loss shoots up). Try adding all the bells and whistlesâ€”save
checkpoints, use early stopping, and plot learning curves using TensorBoard.
